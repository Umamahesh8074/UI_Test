        shared via these platforms, including:
      </p>

        <li>
          <strong>User Contact Information</strong>: Such as phone numbers for
          communication purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Message Interactions</strong>: When users engage with
          businesses via WhatsApp Business, certain message details may be
          collected.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>How We Use Facebook/Meta Data</h4>
      <p>
        - To enable seamless interactions between businesses and users through
        WhatsApp messaging.
        <br />
        - To send notifications, messages, and service updates as requested by
        users.
      </p>

      <h4>Data Sharing</h4>
      <p>
        - We do not sell or share Facebook/Meta data with unauthorized third
        parties.
        <br />
        - We may share user data as required by law, or when users explicitly
        consent to share their data.
      </p>

      <h4>Data Retention</h4>
      <p style="font-weight: 500; margin-bottom: 70px">
        We only retain Facebook/Meta data for as long as is necessary to fulfill
        the purpose for which it was collected. After that, the data is either
        anonymized or deleted.
