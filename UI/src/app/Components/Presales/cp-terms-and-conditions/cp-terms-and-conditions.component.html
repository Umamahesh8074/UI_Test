      <li>
        <strong>Lead Tagging at Site Visit</strong>
        <p>
          Channel Partners must accompany the customer on their first site visit
          in order to be eligible for lead credit.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No Prior Registration Required</strong>
        <p>
          The current lead registration system will be discontinued.<br />
          No advance lead registration is required under the new system.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Credit Policy</strong>
        <p>
          Credit will be awarded to the first Channel Partner who brings the
          customer for a site visit.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Exceptions:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Company-generated Digital/Reference leads are not eligible for
            partner credit.
          </li>
          <li>
            However, if such a lead is in any of the following statuses —
            <em
              >Ringing No Response (RNR), Non-Contactable, Lost, or Not
              Interested</em
            >
            — and a Channel Partner successfully brings the customer for a
            visit, credit will be awarded to the Channel Partner.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Booking Conversion Window</strong>
        <p>
          A 45-day window from the date of the first site visit will be provided
          for booking conversion.<br />
          If the lead is not converted within this period, it will move to the
          Lost stage.<br />
          After 45 days, the same customer can be brought in again by any
          Channel Partner as a new lead for a fresh site visit.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No Credit for Pre-Registered Leads</strong>
       <p> Leads that are already registered cannot be considered. Therefore, please accompany the customers during site visits, and ensure proper tagging is done.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      We believe this new approach will bring greater clarity, fairness, and
      efficiency to the lead management process.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should you have any questions or require further clarification, please
      don’t hesitate to reach out to me.
